# Session: Test Runs — Feb 27, 2026

## Goal
Validate the end-to-end workflow for competition day: clone repo, install deps, port v0 templates, build, push, verify Vercel deploys.

## What Happened

### Test Run 1: 3D Block Art (Three.js)
- Merged v0 zip (shadcn scaffolding only — creative component was missing)
- Built a simple photo hero first, then discovered the zip doesn't include the main component
- Extracted `next-blocks.tsx` source from the v0 preview iframe via Chrome browser
- Adapted to spell "VIBE" with 3D block letters using Three.js / @react-three/fiber
- Deployed successfully to preview branch

### Test Run 2: Pong Pixel Art (Canvas)
- Template: "Prompting Is All You Need" (`v0.app/templates/prompting-is-all-you-need-tokU2y8gQ4D`)
- Extracted `prompting.tsx` source from preview iframe
- Adapted with "HELLO WORLD" (large) and "ML LISBON OFFSITE" (small) pixel text
- Added missing pixel maps for H, W, B, F letters
- Deployed successfully to preview branch

## Key Discovery
v0 zip files only contain scaffolding. The actual creative component must be extracted from the preview iframe at `*.vusercontent.net` using the browser extension.

## Branch State
- `test-run`: 3 commits ahead of main
- `main`: untouched (still original Hello World)

## Decisions Made
- Use CDN `<link>` tags for Geist fonts (not `next/font/google`) due to proxy
- Use `@theme inline` block for Tailwind v4 + shadcn CSS variable integration
- Use `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })` for all client-heavy components
